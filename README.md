# README

Members of the [OASIS Universal Business Language (UBL) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ubl/) create and manage technical content in this TC GitHub repository (https://github.com/oasis-tcs/codelist-genericode/) as part of the TC's chartered work (the program of work and deliverables described in its [charter](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ubl/charter.php).

OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in [GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work), are governed by the OASIS [TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process), [IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), and other policies. While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these repositories are distinct from [OASIS Open Repositories](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories), which are used for development of open source [licensed](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses) content.

## Description

The purpose of this repository is The OASIS genericode specification incorporates documentation and a number of supporting machine-readable artefacts for the representation and IT-enablement of coded domains populated by "a set of codes representing X". This will
satisfy an implementation of the Functional Services View of code lists where the Business Operational View is documented in ISO/IEC 15944-10.

The documentation is to be authored in XML and published in two layouts: the OASIS specification layout and the ISO/IEC Directives Part 2 layout (the latter for potential PAS submission to JTC 1 for international standardization).

Various artefacts, existing and identified to be developed, will be incorporated into the repository for inclusion in the final deliverable.
