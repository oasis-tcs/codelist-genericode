      <para>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through
        technical committees established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC,
        also take part in the work. In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1. </para>

      <para>The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75% of the

      <title>Overview</title>
      <para>Code lists, or enumerated values, have been with us since long before computers. They should be well understood and easily dealt with by now. Unfortunately, they are not. As is often the case, if you take a fundamentally simple concept, you find that everyone professes to understand it
        with complete clarity. When you look more closely, you find that everybody has their own unique view of what the problem is and how it should be solved.</para>
      <para>If code lists were really so simple and obvious, there would already be a single, well-known and accepted way of handling them in XML. There is no such agreed solution, though. The problem is that while code lists are a well understood concept, people don’t actually agree exactly on what
        code lists are, and how they should be used.</para>
      <para>The OASIS Code List Representation format, “<emphasis role="italic">genericode</emphasis>”<footnote id="fn1">
          <para>Genericode can be written starting either with an upper-case or lower-case “g”.  It depends whether genericode is at the start of the sentence or not.</para>
        </footnote>, is a single model and XML format (with a W3C XML Schema) that can encode a broad range of code list information. The XML format is designed to support interchange or distribution of
        machine-readable code list information between systems. Note that genericode is <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> designed as a run-time format for accessing code list information, and is not optimized for such usage. Rather, it is designed as an interchange format that can be transformed
        into formats suitable for run-time usage, or loaded into systems that perform run-time processing using code list information.</para>
      <para>This version 1.0 of genericode implements the “Version 1.0 Requirements” from the OASIS Code List Representation Requirements document, version 1.0.1 (<ulink url="http://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/cd-genericode-1.0/doc/oasis-code-list-representation-requirements-1.0.1.pdf"
          conformance="skip">http://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/cd-genericode-1.0/doc/oasis-code-list-representation-requirements-1.0.1.pdf</ulink>). The requirements document also lists requirements for future versions of genericode, which will not be discussed further in this version of this

  <section id="S-WHAT-IS-A-CODE-LIST" role="non-normative">
    <title>What is a Code List?</title>
    <para>What is a code list, then? Most people would agree that the following is a code list:</para>
    <para>{“SUN”, “MON”, “TUE”, “WED”, “THU”, “FRI”, “SAT”}</para>
    <para>Example 1: Days of the week: English, uppercase</para>
    <para>This is a perfectly reasonable set of alphabetic codes for representing days of the week. However, so is:</para>
    <para>{“Sun”, “Mon”, “Tue”, “Wed”, “Thu”, “Fri”, “Sat”}</para>
    <para>Example 2: Days of the week: English, mixed case</para>
    <para>These two code lists are similar, but certainly not identical. That said, they can both be used to represent the days of the week. Of course, you could also use:</para>
    <para>{“Dim”, “Lun”, “Mar”, “Mer”, “Jeu”, “Ven”, “Sam”}</para>
    <para>Example 3: Days of the week: French, mixed case</para>
    <para>which is created from abbreviations for the days of the week in French. Then again, you could use:</para>
    <para>{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}</para>
    <para>Example 4: Days of the week: numeric</para>
    <para>which is suitable as a computer representation, e.g. for a database column. On the other hand:</para>
    <para>{“S”, “M”, “T”, “W”, “T”, “F”, “S”}</para>
    <para>Example 5: Days of the week: English, single character</para>
    <para>is not suitable as a code list for the days of the week, because the values are not unique.</para>
    <para>Now suppose that you are using codes to represent days of the week in an application, and you are displaying the days of the week using 3-letter abbreviations in English or French. In that context, should <ulink
        url="http://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/cs-genericode-1.0/doc/oasis-code-list-representation-genericode.html#Example%202" conformance="skip">Example 2</ulink> and <ulink
        url="http://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/cs-genericode-1.0/doc/oasis-code-list-representation-genericode.html#Example%203" conformance="skip">Example 3</ulink> be considered to be code lists, or should they be considered to be display values that would be keyed to either the <ulink
        url="http://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/cs-genericode-1.0/doc/oasis-code-list-representation-genericode.html#Example%201" conformance="skip">Example 1</ulink> or <ulink url="http://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/cs-genericode-1.0/doc/oasis-code-list-representation-genericode.html#Example%204"
        conformance="skip">Example 4</ulink> codes? The fact is, they could be either code lists or display values. A value which is a code in one context might only be an associated value for that code in another context. Nothing privileges any of these code lists over the others in terms of
      ability or suitability to be the code list (except the <ulink url="http://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/cs-genericode-1.0/doc/oasis-code-list-representation-genericode.html#Example%205" conformance="skip">Example 5</ulink> values which are not suitable). There is a choice of code lists that can
      be used, and the answer to the question “which choice is the best?” depends on the needs of each particular situation.</para>
    <para>What the above examples show is that for each <emphasis role="italic">distinct entry</emphasis> in a code list, there are many possible associated values (we use the term <emphasis role="italic">distinct entry</emphasis> to express the idea that we are talking a single item that needs to
      be represented in the code list, rather than about the code value(s) that can be used to identify that item). Some of those associated values are suitable for use in code lists, some are not. This leads to a tabular model, where each row of the table represents a conceptual code, and each
      column represents an associated value (code list metadata), as follows:</para>

    <para>Here, the first two columns are each a key column. The last two columns are not individually key columns, but together they form a <emphasis role="italic">compound key</emphasis>, i.e. while the individual columns do not contain unique values, the pair of values is unique within each row.
      This is again similar to what happens in some relational databases, that a key for the rows need not be constructed from a single column, but instead may be constructed by combining two or more columns.</para>
    <para>Finally, there is no reason why a column should only contain simple values like strings or numbers. A column could also contain a complex compound group of data, such as a fragment of XML:</para>

    <para>Table 3: Days of the week, version 3</para>
    <para>Notice that the final XHTML column is not marked as a key column. The values are unique, so it certainly could be used as a key column. However, sometimes you may not wish to mark a column as a key column, even if the values are unique. The values in the column may not make particularly
      suitable keys. They might be too long to process quickly and conveniently, or they might not be able to be used in a particular context, such as for an XML attribute value. Also, it may be that while the values in a particular column are unique now, there is no guarantee or expectation that
      they will remain unique as the code list grows or changes in the future.</para>
    <para>Once you see the tabular nature that underlies the information that can be associated with code lists, it becomes clear why they can be a source of so much debate. Different users need different subsets of the code list information, and people often assume that the information they need is
      all the information that anyone needs.</para>
    <para>That kind of thinking doesn’t work well with code lists, because code lists are sufficiently generic a concept that they are used across messages/documents, applications, and databases. The code list details that you need for the XML schemas often will not be exactly the same as the
      details that you need for your database or your application. If the code list information cannot be shared easily across these different areas, the result is duplication of effort and potential loss of synchronization between different implementations of the same code list.</para>
    <para>The XML schema may only require a set of 3-letter codes to represent the code list. The database may require a set of numeric codes, plus display labels (possibly in different languages). The application may need to know which 3-letter code corresponds to which numeric code, so that it can
      process the XML and update the database. Also, some information related to a code list might not be appropriate for the XML format. For example, if you have a different image file for each code, it isn’t ideal to include this image inline in the code list XML, since it vastly increases the
      size of the XML, and makes it more difficult to read. So in an XML representation, you are more likely to include some reference (e.g. a URL) to the image. For a database, however, it may be feasible to store the image in a BLOB<footnote id="fn2">
          <para>Binary Large OBject.</para>
        </footnote> column in a database.</para>
    <para>One last piece of experience from databases is that support for undefined values will be required. Sometimes users will have values that need to be associated with some of the codes in a code list, but won’t have values to associate with every code. In that case, the concept of a undefined
      (nil or null) value is needed.</para>

    <para>This section describes the genericode model and XML format for representing code lists. The “<code>gc</code>” XML prefix refers to the namespace URI</para>

    <section id="S-TABULAR-STRUCTURE">
      <title>Tabular Structure</title>
      <para>Genericode has a tabular structure for code list information. Each row in the table represents a single <emphasis role="italic">distinct entry</emphasis> in the code list, i.e. each row represents a single uniquely identifiable item in the code list.</para>
      <para>Each column in the table represents a metadata value that can be defined for each distinct entry in the code list. Each column is either <emphasis role="italic">required</emphasis> or <emphasis role="italic">optional</emphasis>. A <emphasis role="italic">required column</emphasis> does
        not allow any row to have an undefined (nil or null) value. An <emphasis role="italic">optional column</emphasis> allows undefined values.</para>
      <para>A genericode <emphasis role="italic">key</emphasis> is a set of one or more required columns that together uniquely identify each distinct entry in the code list. Optional columns cannot be used for keys. Each code list must have at least one key. Genericode keys are equivalent to what
        people usually mean when they talk about the “codes” in a code list. However, genericode allows multiple keys for each code list, and there is no single <emphasis role="italic">preferred</emphasis> key. For code lists that have multiple keys, it is assumed that the choice of which key to use
        is a <emphasis role="italic">late binding</emphasis> choice that is specific to the application, technology and/or context in which the code list is used.</para>

      <title>Column Sets – Columns and Keys</title>
      <para>A column set is a set of definitions of genericode columns and/or keys. A column defines a particular metadata value that can be defined for each distinct entry in a code list. A key defines a set of one or more columns.</para>
      <para>It is not necessary to use separate column set documents. A genericode code list document can contain all of the required column and key definitions. Column set documents are provided as a convenience mechanism for sharing column and/or key definitions between multiple code lists.</para>
      <para>This figure is in UML notation. Each column set must have a unique ID. For a column set defined within a code list document, the code list document's unique identifier is used. A column set can define any number of columns. It can also reference any number of columns from other column
        sets (in column set documents or code list documents). A column set can also define any number of keys. Each key is defined by one or more of the columns in the column set (either defined or imported). Keys are used to uniquely identify the rows (distinct entries) of code lists. Columns and
        keys are uniquely named within the column set that defines them, and each can also be uniquely identified using a specific URI if required additionally.</para>
      <para>The matching genericode W3C XML Schema (WXS) representation of column set content is:</para>
      <para>This figure is in XML Spy® notation. A default datatype library URI can be provided to identify which datatype library should be used for columns which do not explicitly specify a datatype library. If this URI is not provided, the datatype library defaults to the W3C XML Schema (WXS)
        datatype library.</para>
      <para>A column set definition contains optional user annotation information (Annotation), and then identification and location information (Identification). A column set has a short name, any number of long names and a version.</para>
      <para>A column set is uniquely identified by a canonical URI. Particular versions of the column set are uniquely identified by a canonical version URI. Location URIs can also be provided to suggest URLs from which an XML genericode column set instance may be retrieved (at the discretion of an
        application). <emphasis role="italic">Alternative location URIs</emphasis> can be provided to suggest URLs from which non-genericode representations of the column set can be retrieved. Canonical URIs and canonical version URIs must not be used as <emphasis role="italic">de facto</emphasis>
        location URIs for retrieving column set instances (nor anything else). The column set definition can also list the details of the agency which is responsible for publishing and/or maintaining the column set information.</para>
      <para>A column definition (Column) contains a unique ID for the column and its use (required or optional). It also contains a short name (token) for the column, any number of long names, and optional extra canonical identification URIs. The datatype information for the column is contained in
        its Data element.</para>
      <para>The Data structure is based on the data element in RELAX NG. The datatype is specified as a Type from a DatatypeLibrary. If the datatype library is not specified, it is inherited from the DatatypeLibrary attribute of the enclosing column set definition. It otherwise defaults to the W3C
        XML Schema (WXS) datatype library.</para>
      <para>If the data is XML (complex valued), the DataTypeLibrary is set to the namespace URI for the XML (or to “*” if any namespace<footnote id="fn3">

        </footnote> is allowed), and the Type is set to the root element name for the XML data (or to “*” if any root element is allowed).</para>
      <para>Data definitions can contain Parameter elements which define facets that refine the datatype. When using the WXS datatype library, these are just the usual WXS datatype facets.</para>
      <para>If a column is defined in an external column set or code list document, it is referenced using a ColumnRef. The column reference must have an ID just as a column definition would, but it also has an ExternalRef which contains the column's ID in the external document. The external column
        set or code list is identified by a CanonicalVersionUri and/or by any LocationUri information that is provided.</para>
      <para>A key definition (Key) contains an ID for the key. It also contains a short name (token) for the key, any number of long names, and optional extra canonical identification URIs. The columns which together form the key are referenced using one or more ColumnRef elements. The Ref attribute
        of each contains the ID of either a Column or ColumnRef in the column set. Only required (not optional) columns may be used within a key (note that this rule is not able to be enforced using the genericode WXS Schema alone).</para>
      <para>If a key is defined in an external column set or code list document, it can be referred to using a KeyRef. The key reference must have an ID, and also has an ExternalRef which contains the key's ID in the external document. The external column set or code list is identified by a

      <title>Code lists</title>
      <para>A code list can contain its own embedded column set definition. It can also import columns and keys from any number of external column sets (in column set documents and/or code list documents). In the simplest case, what a code list provides is information (metadata) about the code list
        and (optionally) a set of rows, where each row defines a <emphasis role="italic">distinct entry</emphasis> in the code list.</para>
      <para>A code list document that contains only information (metadata) about the code list as a whole is known as a <emphasis role="italic">CodeList Metadata</emphasis> document. If the code list document defines (zero or more) row, it is a <emphasis role="italic">Simple CodeList</emphasis>.
        These are the only kinds of code list that are supported in this version of the specification.</para>
      <para>There is an important difference between a <emphasis role="italic">CodeList Metadata</emphasis> document and <emphasis role="italic">Simple CodeList</emphasis> that contains zero rows (zero distinct entries). The former does not provide information on how many <emphasis role="italic"
          >distinct entries</emphasis> are contained in the code list. The latter explicitly indicates that a particular version of the code list contains zero distinct entries, i.e. the particular version of the code list is empty. A CodeList Metadata document does not provide any indication about
        whether a code list is empty or not.</para>
      <section id="S-SIMPLE-CODELISTS-AND-CODELIST-METADATA">
        <title>Simple CodeLists and CodeList Metadata</title>
        <para>A <emphasis role="italic">CodeList Metadata</emphasis> document is a special case of a <emphasis role="italic">Simple CodeList</emphasis> document. The differences will be discussed explicitly where appropriate.</para>
        <para>A <emphasis role="italic">Simple CodeList</emphasis> is modeled as follows:</para>
        <para>A <emphasis role="italic">Simple CodeList</emphasis> contains zero or more rows (it is necessary to support empty code lists to allow for code lists that are empty now, but will be populated in future versions). Each <emphasis role="italic">Row</emphasis> defines a single <emphasis
            role="italic">distinct entry</emphasis> in the code list.</para>
        <para>A <emphasis role="italic">Row</emphasis> contains one or more <emphasis role="italic">Values</emphasis>, where each of those values corresponds to a distinct column in the code list. At least one value is required, because a code list has to have at least one key, and each key requires
          at least one column. As a consequence, a <emphasis role="italic">Row</emphasis> must have at least one <emphasis role="italic">Value</emphasis>. Additionally, a <emphasis role="italic">Row</emphasis> must contain a defined <emphasis role="italic">Value</emphasis> for each of the <emphasis
            role="italic">required columns</emphasis> in the code list, i.e. for those columns for which a <emphasis role="italic">Value</emphasis> must be defined (non-null) for each <emphasis role="italic">Row</emphasis> (distinct entry) in the code list.</para>
        <para>Each <emphasis role="italic">Value</emphasis> is associated with a single distinct column of the code list. For each <emphasis role="italic">Key</emphasis> in the code list, the values associated with the columns for that key must form a unique set, i.e. no two rows are allowed to have
          the same set of values for the same key columns. Note that this uniqueness requirement cannot be enforced using the genericode WXS Schema for code list documents, which is structured as follows:</para>
        <para>Many of these elements and types have appeared already in section <xref linkend="S-COLUMN-SETS--COLUMNS-AND-KEYS"/>, so the explanations will not be repeated here. A code list document can either define its own embedded ColumnSet, or refer to an externally defined column set using a
          ColumnSetRef.</para>
        <para>A ColumnSetRef contains the canonical version URI which uniquely identifies a referenced column set or code list document which contains the column set. It can also contain suggested URLs from which to retrieve the column set or code list. Canonical version URIs must not be used as
            <emphasis role="italic">de facto</emphasis> location URIs for retrieving column set instances (nor anything else).</para>
        <para>A code list document that contains a SimpleCodeList element is a Simple CodeList. If the code list document does not contain a SimpleCodeList element, then it is a CodeList Metadata document.</para>
        <para>The genericode WXS Schema representation of a SimpleCodeList is</para>
        <para>A SimpleCodeList contains zero or more Row elements. Each Row contains one or more Value elements.</para>
        <para>The Value container element is needed to allow optional user annotations of individual values in the code list. It has a ColumnRef attribute which contains the unique document ID of the associated column. A Value element can contains either a SimpleValue containing a textual value, or
          a ComplexValue containing a balanced (well-formed) XML fragment from a namespace other than the genericode namespace.</para>
        <para>If a <code>Value</code> element does not contain either a <code>SimpleValue</code> element or a <code>ComplexValue</code> element, then the value is undefined. Only <emphasis role="italic">optional columns</emphasis> are allowed to have undefined values. Also, if a <code>Row</code>
          element does not contain a <code>Value</code> element corresponding to a particular column, then the row's value for that column is undefined.</para>
        <para>Note that the ColumnRef attribute of a Value is optional. If it is not provided, it is assumed that the column is the one which follows the column associated with the previous value in the row. If the first Value in a Row does not have a ColumnRef, it is assumed to be associated with
          the first column in the column set. It is an error if a row contains more than one value for the same column, or if it does not contain a value for a required column.</para>
        <para>The genericode WXS Schema is not able to validate that the contents of a Value match the datatype of the associated column. Other validation mechanisms should be used to perform datatype validation.</para>

      <para>Many of these elements and types have appeared already in <xref linkend="S-COLUMN-SETS--COLUMNS-AND-KEYS"/>, so the explanations will not be repeated here. A code list set document contains a series of zero or more CodeListRef, CodeListSet, or CodeListSetRef elements.</para>

      <para>The genericode specification is published as a zip archive in the release directory. Unzipping this archive creates a directory named &directory; containing a “<literal>doc/</literal>” directory with documentation. The authoritative source of the documentation is a master DocBook XML file
        (&directory;.xml), a generated hypertext version of this file (&directory;.html), and a generated PDF version of this file (&directory;.pdf). The files in other subdirectories, linked to from &directory;.xml, &directory;.html, and &directory;.pdf, contain the various normative and informational pieces of the genericode release. A description of each subdirectory is given below. Note that while the genericode.xml file is the “original” of this specification, it may not be viewable in all currently available web browsers.</para>

    <title>The Open-edi reference model perspective of code lists</title>
    <para>ISO/IEC 14662:2010 Information technology - Open-edi reference model <xref linkend="b_openedi"/> has been developed primarily in order to provide standards required for the inter-working of organizations through interconnected information technology systems. Open-edi lowers barriers to
      electronic data interchange by introducing standard business scenarios and the necessary services to support them. </para>
    <para>The Open-edi Reference Model identifies the required standards for Open-edi and provides a reference for those standards by defining the basic concepts used to develop them. </para>
    <para>

    <para>The BOV addresses the aspects of the semantics of business data in business transactions and associated data interchanges which apply to the business needs of Open-edi. The BOV-related standards are tools and rules by which users who understand the operating aspects of a business domain
      may create scenarios. </para>
    <para>The FSV addresses the supporting services meeting the mechanistic needs of Open-edi, focusing on information technology aspects of functional capabilities, service interfaces, and protocols. </para>
